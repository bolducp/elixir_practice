# Exercise:ModulesAndFunctions-6
# Iâ€™m thinking of a number between 1 and 1000....The most efficient way to find
# the number is to guess halfway betweenthe low and high numbers of the range.
# If our guess is too big, then theanswer lies between the bottom of the range
# and one less than our guess. If our guess is too small, then the answer lies
# between one more than our guess and the end of the range.
# Your API will be guess(actual,range), where range is an Elixir range.
